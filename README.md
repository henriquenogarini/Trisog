# Trisog

**Trisog** is a travel booking website, considered a "clone" of traditional travel websites. On this website, you can:

- Search for trips.
- Access details of each trip, including destinations, locations, descriptions, and prices per person.
- Obtain different prices for adults and children.
- View the trip location via Google Maps.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/henriquenogarini/Desafio_03_PB_Compass.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Travelling
    ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

4. **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Open a terminal in the `backend` folder and execute the command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. In another terminal, navigate to the `frontend` folder and execute the command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Now, the project will be running on your machine, both the server and the frontend. You can add objects to the backend database using tools like Insomnia or Postman.

## Main Libraries Used
